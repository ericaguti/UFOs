## Summary 
A drawback to this website, it the inputing for the search parameters need to be lower cased letters, if you enter in 'Circle' instead of 'circle' no results appear. Future improvements for the website would be to incorporate news articles of UFO sightings, in addition to a map of the sightings over time.
